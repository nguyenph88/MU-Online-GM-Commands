GM Commands

/move Name MapNumber XX YY

Moves a user to the location you specify. Move commands (single and guild) can take several seconds to work.

/Disconnect Name

Disconnects a user.

/DisableChat Name

Muzzles a user - they are unable to speak, normally or in PM, until you unmuzzle them or they re-enter the game.

/EnableChat Name

Unmuzzles a user.

/GuildMove GuildName MapNumber XXX YYY

Warps an entire guild (all online members) to the location you specify. If more than one member is online, each additional warped character will appear in the next adjacent unoccupied space. Can be buggy with large guilds (if all adjacent spaces to the coordinate you specify are occupied, some users may get warped back to the nearest town). GuildName is case-sensitive.

/GuildDisconnect GuildName

Disconnects all online members of the guild you specify.

/GuildWarEnd GuildName
/GuildWarStart GuildName
/GuildWarStop GuildName

oops! I forgot which of these does what... I'll update when I next log in

/RemainTime AccountName ####

Sets the remaining time that the specified user has on the server. This is only used for Pay2Play servers (craaaaap lol). After the specified time is used up, the user is unable to log into his/her characters. Time is in minutes, with a maximum of 65535 (45.5 days lol). Use of this command differs between 0.97/0.97b+d servers, I think.

/Trans Name or /Trace Name

Warps the GM to the user specified (or to saved coordinates, if that user is offline)

/SetBlock Name [Value]

Blocks the specified character (sets ctlCode to 1). Blocks that character ONLY, not the account (blocked character's name in Character Selection screen is highlighted in yellow). I THINK this can be used to make another user GM, by specifying a ctlCode, but still playing around with it - update soon

/UnsetBlock Name

Removes a pre-existing block on the specified account (sets ctlCode to 0). Cannot be used to remove GM status (only works on ctlCode 1, at least when I tested).

!Message

Broadcasts "Message" as a global notification (Event Message or Announcement) with gold text on every user's screen.
